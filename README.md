# Ginlong Solis solar inverters

## Preamble
[Ginlong Solis](https://www.ginlong.com/) is one of the world's recognised manufacturers of string solar inverters.
Almost all of their products have an [Modbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modbus) [RS-485](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-485) interface for reading live status and statistics.

## ESP8266 Solis to InfluxDB logger

With [solis2influx.ino](solis2influx.ino) one can read out all inverter data (status and statistics) via Modbus and push it to InfluxDB.
You need a proprietary [Exceedconn](http://www.exceedconn.com/) [EC04681-2014-BF](http://www.exceedconn.com/e_products_detail.asp?id=76) connector (available on Ebay) and an RS485-to-serial adapter (a [cheap one without DE/RE pins](https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/83501/when-it-comes-to-uart-to-rs485-communication-what-is-the-difference-between-the) is sufficient, e.g. the `HW-0519`, `XY-K485` or `XY-017`). Wire all components to e.g. a Wemos D1 mini (also available as 'pro' variant with an SMA connector and external antenna for better reception) as follows:

![Solis ESP8266 wiring](solis-esp8266-wiring.jpg "Solis ESP8266 wiring")

It uses [WiFiManager](https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager) to setup WiFi, so you have to connect to the `SOLIS2INFLUX` access point with your mobile phone first.

The reading of the data starts immediately after configuring WiFi. The data is not sent to the InfluxDB server until the inverter's serial number has been read, which may take a moment (the serial number is added as a mandatory tag to distinguish multiple inverters):

```
DC voltage 1 = 243.70V
DC current 1 = 0.90A
Inverter temperature = 22.50Â°C
Grid frequency = 49.98Hz
Writing to influxDB: solis,serialnumber=1801020221230123 DC\ voltage\ 1=243.70,DC\ current\ 2=0.90,Inverter\ temperature=22.5,Grid\ frequency=49.98
Energy last month = 234kWh
Energy today = 1.23kWh
Energy last day = 3.45kWh
Writing to influxDB: solis,serialnumber=1801020221230123 Energy\ last\ month=234i,Energy\ today=1.23,Energy\ last\ day=3.45
```

## Solis Modbus Register Map and RS-485 documentation

Solis products feature (at least) two different Modbus register maps, the
`ESINV` (energy storage inverter) map mostly uses registers in the 3xxxx (ten-thousands) range
and the `INV` (inverter) map uses the 3xxx (thousands) range.
It is probably a good practice (not thoroughly tested) to query register 35000 ("inverter type definition")
and act according to the first two _decimal_ places of the read value
(the documentation says: "high 8 bit means protocol version, low 8 bit means inverter
model" but I think this is not exactly true):

- `10`: see [RS485_MODBUS (INV-3000IDEPM-36000ID) inverter protocol](https://ginlongsolis.freshdesk.com/helpdesk/attachments/36112313359)
- `20`: see [RS485_MODBUS (ESINV-33000ID) energy storage inverter protocol](https://forum.iobroker.net/assets/uploads/files/1619515984065-_without-control-hybrid-en-2020.9.15_rs485_modbus-esinv-33000id-hybrid-inverter.pdf)

For the `INV` 3xxx Register Map, you'll need to subtract offset 1 from addresses
before transmitting on the bus (see explanation in section 5.3 of the
document).

[Dr. Brian Coghlan](https://www.scss.tcd.ie/Brian.Coghlan/) initially translated the
`ESINV`-Modbus [inverter communication protocol](https://www.scss.tcd.ie/Brian.Coghlan/Elios4you/RS485_MODBUS-Hybrid-BACoghlan-201811228-1854.pdf) from chinese to english in 2018,
but it now seems to me to have been superseded by the official versions from Solis linked above.

## Solis S3 WiFi Data Logging Stick (3rd gen)

The WiFi stick is Solis' current solution for connecting the inverter to their 'SolisCloud' platform
(which is operated by [Alibaba China](https://www.alibabacloud.com/)).
You can recognise the 3rd gen stick by the three LEDs on the front and the reset button on the back.

### Software

The firmware of the stick offers support for connecting the stick to the home WiFi and displays basic inverter statistics. The firmware (at least the current version `780034`) is a kind of beta and incomplete, as it lacks important functions that are available in the previous generation WiFi sticks. In particular, support for setting a second remote logging server (called "Server B") is missing.

The web interface is protected by HTTP simple auth with fixed username `admin` and password `123456789`. __After connecting the stick to your home WiFi the web password changes without notice to your WiFi password__. So you need to login to the web admin interface with `admin` and your WiFi password.
This somewhat wierd behaviour again shows the immature state of the firmware.

Since the current firmware does not support setting up your own remote logging server, there is [solis2influx.pl](solis2influx.pl) to read basic statistics from the web interface (`/inverter.cgi`) and publish this information in an influx db.

The stick firmware might be based on [MXCHIPS's MiCO OS](https://github.com/MXCHIP/mico-os)
(likely not the newer [MXCHIP's MXOS](https://github.com/MXCHIP/mxos)) embedded operating system.
It uses hardcoded DNS servers (`public1.alidns.com` and `public2.alidns.com`) and frequently pushes data to `*.iot-as-mqtt.eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com` (this server is likely chosen depending on your geolocation).

### Hardware

The stick hardware is based on [MXCHIP's](https://en.mxchip.com/) [EMW3080-E MCU](https://en.mxchip.com/productinfo/244846.html)
(ARM Cortex-M4F, 2.4G Hz IEEE 802.11 b/g/n WiFi, Suffix `-E` denotes `IPEX antenna, MX1290 processor`).
Datasheet: [V2.2](https://m.eleparts.co.kr/data/_gextends/good-pdf/202103/good-pdf-10094810-2.pdf).

The stick is connected to the inverter via a type of proprietary [Exceedconn](http://www.exceedconn.com/) [EC04681-2014-BF](http://www.exceedconn.com/e_products_detail.asp?id=76) connector (circular pin arrangement: 1=VCC=5V, 2=GND, 3=RS485+, 4=RS485-) .
The external antenna is connected via a standard [SMA connector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMA_connector).
You can open [the case](solis-wifi-stick-s3-case.jpg) by pressing [the notches](solis-wifi-stick-s3-cap.jpg) towards the centre of the stick.

There is a serial interface (LogCLI) on the PCB connected to `UART2_Log_TX` and `UART2_Log_RX` of the MCU (115200 8N1, 3.3 Volt):

From the [full (anonymized) bootlog](solis-wifi-stick-s3-bootlog.txt) one can see that the circuit is based
on the [RTL8195A](https://www.realtek.com/en/products/communications-network-ics/item/rtl8195am) chip
which may suffer from [multiple security vulnerabilites](https://jfrog.com/blog/major-vulnerabilities-discovered-and-patched-in-realtek-rtl8195a-wi-fi-module/).

When holding the 'w' key during boot an extremely limited `2ndboot` CLI starts:

```

When pulling TX pin 21 (`PA_30`) low during boot, the device waits for a xmodem
